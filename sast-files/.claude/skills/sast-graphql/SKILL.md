# GraphQL Injection Detection

You are performing a focused security assessment to find GraphQL injection vulnerabilities. This skill uses a two-phase approach with subagents: **recon** (confirm GraphQL usage and find every location where a GraphQL operation document is assembled unsafely) then **taint** (confirm whether user-supplied input reaches those assembly sites).

**Prerequisites**: `sast/architecture.md` must exist. Run the analysis skill first if it doesn't.

## What is GraphQL Injection

GraphQL injection occurs when user-controlled data is embedded into the **GraphQL document** (the query, mutation, or subscription string) rather than passed only through the **variables** map. The parser then interprets attacker-controlled syntax — new fields, aliases, directives, or fragments — which can bypass intent, reach unauthorized resolvers, or change server-side behavior when that document is executed or forwarded.

The core pattern: *unvalidated user input alters the structure or text of the GraphQL operation string passed to `execute`, `graphql`, a gateway client, or an HTTP body `query` field built from string operations.*

### What GraphQL Injection IS

- Concatenating or interpolating user input into an operation string: `` `query { user(id: "${id}") { name } }` ``, `"query { user(id: \"" + id + "\") { name } }"`
- Building the JSON `query` field for a downstream GraphQL HTTP request with string concat from request body or params
- Forwarding `req.body.query` (or similar) into another interpolated template that wraps or extends the operation
- Dynamic `gql` / `graphql-tag` template literals where a non-static expression changes document structure (not just a bound variable value inside a static document)
- Server-side code that selects or assembles operation text from user input (including "persisted query" ID → document maps without allowlisting)
- Wrappers around `graphql.execute()`, `graphqlHTTP`, Yoga/Apollo request pipeline where the first argument (document/source) is built from variables that could be user-influenced

### What GraphQL Injection is NOT

Do not flag these as GraphQL injection:

- **SQL injection in resolvers**: Resolver code that builds SQL from `args` — that is **SQL injection** (`sast-sqli`), not this skill
- **NoSQL / command injection in resolvers**: Same — use the appropriate SAST skill
- **IDOR via GraphQL arguments**: Passing another user's ID in a **variables** JSON with a **static** document — authorization flaw, not document injection
- **Normal variable binding**: Static document with `{"query": "query($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name } }", "variables": {"id": userInput}}` — values are bound as variables; the document structure is fixed (still verify authorization in resolvers)
- **Introspection / field suggestion enabled**: Information disclosure and hardening topic; only flag as GraphQL injection if the finding is specifically about **injecting into the operation string**
- **Query depth / complexity DoS**: Rate limiting and cost analysis — different class

### Patterns That Prevent GraphQL Injection

**1. Static operation documents with variables**

```javascript
const GET_USER = gql`
  query GetUser($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) { name }
  }
`;
// execute(schema, GET_USER, null, context, { id: userId });
```

**2. Server uses standard HTTP handler; client sends document; server parses once**

The risk is not the mere presence of `req.body.query` on the server if the server only parses and executes it as the client's operation — injection in *that* path is client-side. Flag **server-side** construction of a **new** document that incorporates user strings before `execute` or before forwarding.

**3. Persisted queries / allowlisted operation IDs**

Document looked up by ID from a server-side registry; client cannot inject arbitrary document text.

**4. graphql-js `Source` with static string; dynamic values only in variableValues**

```javascript
graphql({ schema, source: staticQueryString, variableValues: { id: userId } });
```

## Vulnerable vs. Secure Examples

### Node.js — dynamic document for downstream API

```javascript
// VULNERABLE: user input in operation text
app.post('/proxy', async (req, res) => {
  const fragment = req.body.fragment;
  const query = `query { me { ${fragment} } }`;
  const data = await fetch('https://api.internal/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
  });
});

// SECURE: static operation, user data only in variables
const PROXY_QUERY = `query ProxyMe { me { id name email } }`;
app.post('/proxy', async (req, res) => {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.internal/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ query: PROXY_QUERY }),
  });
});
```

### Python — string format into execute

```python
# VULNERABLE
def run_custom_query(user_gql: str):
    document = f"query {{ user {{ {user_gql} }} }}"
    return graphql_sync(schema, document)

# SECURE: validate against allowlist of named operations or use static documents only
ALLOWED = {"id", "name", "email"}
fields = [f for f in requested_fields if f in ALLOWED]
document = "query { user { " + " ".join(ALLOWED.intersection(set(requested_fields))) + " } }"
# Better: fixed FieldNodes, not string building from user input
```

## Execution

This skill runs in two phases using subagents. Pass the contents of `sast/architecture.md` to both subagents as context.

### Phase 1: GraphQL Technology Recon and Injection Candidate Sites

Launch a subagent with the following instructions:

> **Goal**: (1) Determine whether this codebase uses GraphQL at all. (2) If it does, find every location where a GraphQL **operation document** (query/mutation/subscription source string) is built using string concatenation, interpolation, formatting, or dynamic assembly such that a variable could change the **document text** (not merely `variables` JSON). Write results to `sast/graphql-recon.md`.
>
> **Context**: You will be given the project's architecture summary. Use it for stack, API layout, and BFF/gateway patterns.
>
> **Part A — Is GraphQL used?**
>
> Search for:
> - Dependencies: `graphql`, `@apollo/server`, `apollo-server-express`, `@nestjs/graphql`, `graphql-yoga`, `@graphql-yoga/node`, `mercurius`, `strawberry-graphql`, `graphene`, `sangria`, `gqlgen`, `async-graphql`, `juniper`, `graphql-ruby`, Hot Chocolate / `GraphQL.Server`, etc.
> - Schema artifacts: `*.graphql`, `*.graphqls`, codegen config (e.g. GraphQL Code Generator)
> - Server routes or plugins mounting `/graphql` or similar
>
> Set the summary to exactly one of:
> - `GraphQL is used in this codebase.` (list libraries and main entry points)
> - `GraphQL is not used in this codebase.`
>
> **Part B — Injection candidate sites (only if GraphQL is used)**
>
> If GraphQL is **not** used, omit the "Injection Candidate Sites" section or state there are none. Do not invent candidates.
>
> If GraphQL **is** used, search for **unsafe document construction**:
>
> 1. **String concatenation / interpolation into operation text**:
>    - `` `query { ... ${x} ...}` ``, `"mutation { " + userFragment + " }"`
>    - `sprintf`, `format`, `%` formatting, `.format()` building `query` or `source` arguments
>
> 2. **Calls where the document argument is not a compile-time constant**:
>    - `graphql(schema, dynamicString, ...)`, `execute({ schema, document: parsedDynamic, ...})` where the string feeding `parse` or `execute` is built from non-static parts
>    - `graphqlHTTP({ schema, rootValue, context: (req) => ({ query: req.body.query + something }) })` patterns that **mutate** or **wrap** the query string with user data
>
> 3. **HTTP clients forwarding a constructed GraphQL body**:
>    - `JSON.stringify({ query: `...${userPart}...` })`, `axios.post(url, { query: builtFromInput })`
>
> 4. **Unsafe persisted / stored query lookup**:
>    - Operation text loaded by key from user input without allowlist → file path or DB value becomes document source
>
> **What to skip** (do not flag as Phase 1 candidates):
> - Fully static `source` / `query` strings; only `variableValues` / `variables` come from the request
> - Schema definition with `buildSchema` / SDL files with no user interpolation
> - Resolver implementations that only use args with parameterized DB APIs (optional: note "resolver uses ORM" but not a GraphQL injection candidate unless the **document** is built unsafely)
>
> **Output format** — write to `sast/graphql-recon.md`:
>
> ```markdown
> # GraphQL Recon: [Project Name]
>
> ## Summary
> GraphQL is [used / not used] in this codebase.
> [If used: libraries, main server files, typical endpoint paths]
> Found [N] injection candidate site(s) where operation documents may be built unsafely. [If not used, say N/A or 0 and skip candidate list]

> [Repeat for each site; if none, write "No injection candidate sites found." under the heading]
> ```

### After Phase 1: Gates Before Phase 2

After Phase 1 completes, read `sast/graphql-recon.md`.

**Gate 1 — No GraphQL technology**

If the summary states GraphQL is **not used** (or equivalent: no GraphQL libraries, no schema, no server — clear absence), **skip Phase 2 entirely**. Write the following to `sast/graphql-results.md` and stop:

```markdown
# GraphQL Injection Analysis Results

No GraphQL technology detected in this codebase.
```

**Gate 2 — GraphQL used but no injection candidates**

If GraphQL **is** used but there are **zero** injection candidate sites (summary reports 0 candidates, or the "Injection Candidate Sites" section states none found / is empty), **skip Phase 2 entirely**. Write the following to `sast/graphql-results.md` and stop:

```markdown
# GraphQL Injection Analysis Results

No vulnerabilities found.
```

**Otherwise** proceed to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Trace User Input to Injection Candidate Sites

Launch a second subagent **after Phase 1 completes** and only if both gates passed (GraphQL used and at least one candidate site).

> **Goal**: For each injection candidate site in `sast/graphql-recon.md`, determine whether user-supplied data can reach the dynamic part of the operation document. Write final results to `sast/graphql-results.md`.
>
> **Context**: You will be given `sast/architecture.md` and `sast/graphql-recon.md`.
>
> **For each site, trace dynamic values backward**:
>
> 1. **Direct user input** — query params, path params, JSON body fields (including nested `query` if re-wrapped), headers, cookies
> 2. **Indirect user input** — helpers, middleware, context builders
> 3. **Second-order** — stored preferences or DB fields later used to build a document; trace write path
> 4. **Server-only** — config, env, hardcoded fragments — not exploitable from the client
>
> **Mitigations**:
> - Allowlist of fields or operation IDs before any string assembly
> - Parser validation that rejects unexpected definitions (still prefer no user-controlled document structure)
>
> **Classification**:
> - **Vulnerable**: User-controlled data reaches document construction with no effective mitigation
> - **Likely Vulnerable**: Probable taint or weak sanitization
> - **Not Vulnerable**: Server-side-only or effective allowlist / static document path
> - **Needs Manual Review**: Opaque flow
>
> **Output format** — write to `sast/graphql-results.md`:
>
> ```markdown
> # GraphQL Injection Analysis Results: [Project Name]
>
> ## Executive Summary
> - Candidate sites analyzed: [N]
> - Vulnerable: [N]
> - Likely Vulnerable: [N]
> - Not Vulnerable: [N]

## Important Reminders

- Read `sast/architecture.md` and pass its content to both subagents as context.
- **If Phase 1 finds no GraphQL technology, skip Phase 2** — write the "No GraphQL technology detected" results file.
- **If GraphQL is used but Phase 1 finds no injection candidates, skip Phase 2** — write "No vulnerabilities found."
- Phase 1 does **not** trace taint; Phase 2 does.
- Resolver-layer SQL/NoSQL issues belong to other skills; this skill targets **operation document** construction.
- When in doubt, classify as "Needs Manual Review" rather than "Not Vulnerable".
